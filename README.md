# P/E/T/S (Rewritten)

So as it turns out, using C2 wasn't exactly a good idea for this game. Rewriting
the whole game in Godot now, which will probably take a while, since Godot 4 is
pretty new...

Probably gonna use
[godot-rust/gdextension](https://github.com/godot-rust/gdextension) at some
point, but it's unstable right now, and constantly releasing breaking changes so
yea-no thanks we're not doing that yet. ðŸ¦€

Feel free to submit PRs and whatever, but I can't guarantee I'll be too active.

This game is... well, obviously... free and open-source software!

## Important

This project will be staying on Godot v4.0 for the time being...
