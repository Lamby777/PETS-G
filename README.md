# P/E/T/S (Rewritten)

So as it turns out, using C2 wasn't exactly a good idea for this game. Rewriting
the whole game in Godot now, which will probably take a while, since Godot 4 is
fairly new...

Feel free to submit PRs and whatever, but I can't guarantee I'll be too active.

Using [godot-rust/gdext](https://github.com/godot-rust/gdextension) for complex
parts because compile-time type safety go brrrr. Prefer GDScript for the simple
parts of the game's code, though.

Using Godot version 4.1.1

This game is... well, obviously... free and open-source software! Yay! ðŸŽ‰

Many of my favorite games are either entirely free (no microtransactions) OR
open-source / respect your digital freedoms. Be the change you wish to see in
the world, right?
