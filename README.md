[JUST LET ME PLAY THE DAMN GAME!](/just-start-the-damn-game.md)

Rewriting my game I started back in 2019, except actually finishing it this time
because I picked a good game engine that doesn't make basic programming and
control of your own hardware overly complicated... and is also open-source! <3

On Godot version 4.3

Using [godot-rust/gdext](https://github.com/godot-rust/gdextension) for most of
the stuff, because of the type system. Prefer GDScript for things that probably
won't need to interact with Rust code, and are simpler to just write as GDScript
scripts (for example, enemy attack patterns or NPC dialogue).

This game is... well, obviously... free and open-source software! Yay! ðŸŽ‰

Many of my favorite games are either entirely free (no microtransactions) OR
open-source / respect your digital freedoms. Be the change you wish to see in
the world, right?
