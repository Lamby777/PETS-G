# P/E/T/S (Rewritten)

[JUST LET ME PLAY THE DAMN GAME!](/just-start-the-damn-game.md)

Rewriting my game I started back in 2019, except actually finishing it this time
because I picked a good game engine that doesn't make basic programming and
control of your own hardware overly complicated... and is also open-source! <3

On Godot version 4.2.2

Using [godot-rust/gdext](https://github.com/godot-rust/gdextension) for most of
the stuff, because of the type system. Prefer GDScript for things that probably
won't need to interact with Rust code, and are simpler to just write as GDScript
scripts.

This game is... well, obviously... free and open-source software! Yay! ðŸŽ‰

Many of my favorite games are either entirely free (no microtransactions) OR
open-source / respect your digital freedoms. Be the change you wish to see in
the world, right?

## (Recommended...?) Workflow

You're probably gonna want to spend most of your time in the `pets-lib` folder.
This is where the Rust side of the codebase is in. The `pets-gd` folder has the
Godot project, but that's edited with the actual Godot editor.

There's a quickstart script in `pets-lib` for my CLI text editor bois. The
`run` script just opens the main scene with whatever arguments you give. This
is pretty nice for testing purposes, but don't worry about reloading the editor
each time... Hot reloads are now supported. You should only have to reload it when
making a new class or changing fields on a class, or anything along those lines.

Refer to
[this wiki page](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/editor/command_line_tutorial.html)
for arguments n stuff to pass into these scripts. One useful argument is `-e`,
which opens the editor instead of running the scene as a game.

When you finish making changes, build the library and start the game. Pretty
self-explanatory from there.
