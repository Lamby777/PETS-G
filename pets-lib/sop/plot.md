## Intro Disclaimers, Worldbuilding Context, etc.

---

A lot of this stuff WILL change. It's not "retconning," it's just revising a plot that happens to be public because I like letting people see the process. Don't judge me for any of this being "cringe" until 1.0 release, the same way you wouldn't judge someone for sus tweets they posted 15 years ago (unless you're stupid or something and think that's a reasonable thing to judge people for idk).

---

The game is very unashamedly [20 Minutes Into The Future](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture) at times. It is a deliberate choice not to care about realistic timeframes if it compromises familiarity and the "Rule of Cool."

In reality, it probably doesn't take place in exactly 2037, either, but can you really disagree with picking a cool-sounding number?
Oh, almost forgot: I originally came up with 2037 because it was a year right before 2038, the year of the 32-bit Unix times overflow bug. People living their lives as usual when everything's falling apart. Very symbolic, right?

For the most part, the timeline diverged with ours somewhere in the 1500-1950 range, but this isn't a hard and fast rule; things from our current timeline WILL exist in this world whenever practical for familiarity. These guys, for the most part, use the same style of vehicles, weapons, electronics, etc. that we have today, just with different brands and slightly cooler sci-fi features.

---

The geography and countries of this world do not at all resemble ours. Corr Valley roughly represents US tech cities (Silicon Valley, D.C. area, etc.), but is in a pretty unique spot, geography-wise. Melpine is a slightly more rural warmer version of Ontario, inspired by a trip I went on early in the game's development. Same inspiration for Constchar, but it's inspired both by the mountainy areas of Iran and part of Turkiye. Everything else in the game is mostly made-up. For example, Constchar Outskirts isn't inspired by any particular place-- mostly just how it felt to listen to the song "A Horse With No Name" by America, which was stuck in my head during that time. That's how abstract it gets, so don't try to overthink it or try to look for an allegory for real geopolitics or anything-- it's not there and anything you come up with will just be your personal beliefs speaking.

---

Similarly, culture and language is not at all developed the same way as our timeline. They speak English for the same convenience reasons mentioned before. However, many names might seem unusual (Mylo, Taine, Cassander) or modified, (Raine, Yusamira, Jolainne, Juliess) or even not like any of our names at all (Winthrus, Quolo, Neoxylin).

- This is because I wanted names that would be fairly unique, but still easily memorable. The same way language evolved over time until now, I wanted names to evolve that way into the future. Sure, the internet will likely have slowed down this process of change, but that's no fun. Rule of Cool, remember?
- Do not assume pronunciations will work the same way. People mispronounce stuff all the time. Some of these mispronunciations became popular enough to be the new "correct" pronunciation. Sorry for this next part, I'm not an expert in linguistics and will probably use some wrong terms.
    - If you see an L with an apostrophe, the apostrophe isn't a dropped vowel like in French. Instead, it's pretty much just pronounced together as L by its own as a syllable. For example, Winthrus's last name "L'aur" would sound something like loh-ARE or lew-ARE, as two separate syllables.
    - Double Ls ("ll") are pronounced as Y, similarly to Spanish. Not formally-- only when convenient. Think of it like a contraction, or one of those phrases that sounds different when you say it fast.
    - Any "ae" suffix has become pronounced to rhyme with "day" or "say."
    - Accent marks are far more common. Don't worry, they still work as usual-- the stress is put on whatever syllable contains them. Sometimes I may have overdone it, putting redundant accent marks, but they'll probably be taken out. Yusamira used to have one on the "u," and I'm thinking of removing the one in Ethan's last name as well.
- And forget about race. I'm not opening that can of worms if I don't have to. The skin tone of a character has nothing to do with any ethnicity recognizable from our world.

---

- On top of that, the companies are mostly fictional and not based around any single real company. Goober is NOT specifically a parody of Google, but rather a parody of all "big tech" companies in general. This isn't a legal disclaimer thing-- I'm serious. Goober mails packages just like Amazon. Goober has many many many world-famous social platforms and (more sci-fi versions of) VR products just like Meta. Goober squeezes almost the entire digital music market like Spotify. Goober built the OS all the laypeople's computers run on, and they own the 2037 version of GitHub where everyone dumps their code, just like Microsoft does. Goober's biggest products are their AI models that the entire world makes requests to, bajillions and gazillions of times per second, like OpenAI. Goober has a ride-sharing and food delivery service just like Uber. Goober owns all the big dating apps just like Match Group. Goober owns all the big crypto exchanges, and all the investment apps, though crypto is seen as less of an "investment" in this world and more like cash. Goober bought out all the payment processors and essentially told them to piss off, so they could launch their own convenient Prokaryo exchange with no competition from traditional payment methods. THEY. DO. IT. ALL. Goober is the company Elon Musk WISHES he could turn X into, if he didn't get sidetracked with trying to become Trump's favorite house pet or whatever. It is THE megacorporation, so don't compare it to "just Google," or I'm telling Mylo to send one of his hitmen after you for being so disrespectful.
    - Shitter IS a complete parody of Twitter, though. That's the exception. And I came up with that looooong before the Twitter Blue crap and the X rebranding, when everybody started calling it that (you can see some blue billboard with a white poop emoji icon named `gshitter` in the git history). The parody is more about the social impact of such a service, and not anything specific the company did after 2021.

---

- Prokaryo is a cryptocurrency used in the game, which has mostly replaced physical currency. It's pretty much just a "movie magic" version of Monero. They figured out a way to have near instant transactions, completely stop centralization in pools, and no longer rely on Proof of Work so there's no energy issue. It's COMPLETELY untraceable without having access to the owner's private keys. No quantum uber-super-duper-computers, no brute forcing, no BS. Don't question it. Movie magic. All you need to know is that it's virtual money, and you can't trace transactions at all unless you own the wallet they're sent from.

## Main Characters

---

### Ethan's Peeps

- Ethan CadÃ³ri: 15 year old boy with asthma who recently moved to Corr Valley. Has a pet sheep named Fuzzy and a pig named Porky. He is very shy and has a bit of a problem making friends, especially after moving. Capable of psychic abilities. Can understand and speak to animals.
- TODO mom/dad

---

### Siva's Peeps

- Sylvia "Siva" Tulivae: 18 year old girl who has lived in Corr Valley her whole life. She is also pretty shy but isn't afraid to stand up for herself or her friends. Well-liked by pretty much everyone in the town. She's also a decent sysadmin; 70% of all Corr Valley critical infrastructure relies on a couple servers in her basement, due to some poor decisions by the government. She got her nickname from a little child trying to say her name and it stuck. Her hair is naturally deep cyan due to a genetic mutation. She is somewhat depressed and has sleep issues. Capable of psychic abilities.
- The Corrian Machinarchists (CMA): A sort of "gang" at Siva's high school. It's all decentralized, but they see Siva as one of their leaders. In reality, it's not really like most gangs. They aren't usually up to mischief, and it's more of an unofficial support group between the students. Their main reason for grouping together is to protest against the robotic treatment of students in the year 2037, where education is a rat race to get the highest grades, and the school board requires hours worth of standardized testing to be done every week.
- TODO mom/dad

---

### The Naturals

- Trino "Terra" Requiem: 21 year old man, rockstar from Melpine Town. He's the lead singer of his band "The Naturals" and is known for his love for nature. He finds taking hikes calming, and it has been a habit for him ever since he lost his best friend while serving in the Melpine Defense Force (MDF). That's also where he got his nickname.
- Leo "Yoyo" Quaint: 17 year old member of The Naturals who does all the audio engineer work for the band, but also plays guitar in his own time as well. He's a huge tech nerd who can hack anything with or without a computer. He's also known for his insatiable love for food, having been the one who decided their band's hideout should be on the second floor of a restaurant they frequent.
- Yusamira "Mira" L'yasu: 19 year old trans girl playing the keyboard/synth for The Naturals. She doesn't actually belong to the game, and was placed there after the fact to watch over the other characters and make sure nothing goes awry. She is almost as good at hacking as Leo, but still has much to learn. She's known for her long curly purple hair and eccentric style. She's also the only one who can speak with the player, not counting any comedic fourth wall breaks.
- Robert "Tables" Sequiella: 19 year old drummer for The Naturals. He's always bored with the "simple" rhythms everyone wants him to play, and loves to experiment with new beats. He's Terra's closest friend, and will do anything to keep him safe. He's also the one who teaches Ethan how to haggle for good prices at shops. He's also good at cheering people up, and helps Leo communicate when he's feeling overwhelmed. His name is a reference to an XKCD comic.
- Dylan "Dubs" Spamboni: 20 year old bassist for The Naturals. He's the most laid-back member of the band, and is always the one to calm everyone down when things get too heated. He has long curly brown hair, and is the only member of the band wearing a # instead of a natural sign on his shirt because he always "looks sharp." His favorite morning activity is plogging, because it helps him wake up while also doing good.

---

### The "Bad Guys"

- L'yembo Richter: 17 year old boy who has a crush on Siva. He's a bit of a troublemaker, but he's not a bad person. He's just been very lonely, and Quolo was the only one who acknowledged his existence and offered to be his friend. They're like 2 peas in a pod. Known for always wearing a white hoodie with the hood up.
- Quolo TorvinÃ­: 17 year old boy who is the biggest troublemaker in Corr Valley. He is very cynical and thinks everyone is out to get him, and he's also a bully in school. The only person he trusts is L'yembo because he was willing to be friends with him despite his bad reputation. Known for always wearing a black hoodie with the hood up.
- The Justicians (kinda placeholder name btw): A group of people who believe Ethan is a scumbag and want to protest against Corr Valley's immigration policy. They're especially furious that Ethan "took along" Siva with him, because the very next day, someone broke into her basement and lots of critical infrastructure almost went down if it weren't for Neoxylin's quick reaction. The main leaders are L'yembo and Quolo, because they want to "prove" themselves to the world and boost their ego by taking down the "biggest threat" to their society.
- Cassander DistantÃ³: ~30 year old detective in Melpine Town. Heavily corrupt, and willing to take bribes to change the outcome of a case. Melpine has very few laws restricting what counts as evidence, and ultimately, Cassander is the one who decides who goes to prison and who doesn't.
- The Pirate Cabal: A secret organized group of pirates which are sworn enemies against Winthrus and his crew. They receive a lot of hate due to their malware-infested cracks and general lack of morals. They're always flat broke, so they're envious of people who do cracks for "fun" or anti-copyright ideology as opposed to doing it to rat people and make a quick buck. They are known for their brutal tactics and are feared by many.
- Calyx: A robot that looks exactly like Siva. It is capable of using all of Siva's abilities. Developed by an extremely bored employee at Goober Labs as a prototype for the Univirus. It is capable of learning and adapting to any situation.

---

### Goober's Goobers

- Goober Labs: A company that specializes in literally everything, with near unlimited market research efforts. They used to be a search engine company, but have since moved onto artificial intelligence and robotics powered by all the user data they collected over the years. They have a monopoly on most of the market, and are known for their shady business practices. Most people who work there are kind, but the structure of the company incentivizes profits by any means necessary. It is a caricature, an exaggeration of most 2020s era big tech companies.
- Goober Labs Upper Echelon (GLUE) - The Final Equation is a formula and ML model that can retrace particles back to any point in the history of the universe and observe past events at will. GLUE is the Goober department responsible for researching the Final Equation, and implementing it for the first time in the real world.
- Mylo: GLUE team lead who gets greedy and scraps the Final Equation project, falsely claiming itâ€™s been proven impossible, in order to personally develop it further and use it for his own self-interests.
- Raine and Taine: Mylo's two assistants who are in charge of managing GLUE servers. They are fraternal twins, and are very kind to others. Their loyalty to Mylo is dubious at best, and they eventually decide to help the team take him down after he betrays them. Raine loves silly things and has a habit of speaking in overly cutesy text-speak, while Taine is more serious and finds her sister to be annoying at times.

---

### The Pirates

- Captain Winthrus L'aur: ~25 year old male pirate. He has a pirate hat and a peg-leg, but he also pirates software, too. He runs a business selling cracked software and movies for cheap to people on the internet, promising none of his cracks contain malware. He's a very chill dude overall, and believes it is his duty to share content he has access to with anyone who wants it.
- Juliess "Juno" Jan: ~21 year old enby pirate who works for Winthrus. A friend of Winthrus who lives in Constchar. He's a very good cook. He's also a good friend of Nyx, and is always willing to help her out with anything she needs.

---

### Other Characters

- Rumble and Esther: A couple of moles who live in the underground. They're both very friendly and are always willing to help out anyone who needs it. They're also very good at digging, and have a network of tunnels that span the entire continent.
- Colt "Clancy" Cohan: A cowboy who travels the world, selling top quality weapons and armor. Good friends with Terra.
- Empress Neoxylin "Nyx" Cereze: 14 year old mayor of Corr Valley. She's very intelligent and has a good heart, but she's also very naive. She gets scammed out of a lot of money by Goober Labs in inventing the first human-android hybrid when Goober Labs employees steal her work and run off, leaving no trace. She does what's right for the people of her city, even if some of the people may hate her for it. Also referred to as Princess instead of Empress. Interchangeable. Who chares?

## Plot Points

---

### Intro

- First, Ethan moves in to the new house, and gets Fuzzy out of the car (Porky went missing along the way there).
- Ethan goes to school, and does a school project.
- Ethan goes home and finds Fuzzy is missing and sees 2 kids in his backyard eating lambchops. (it was just a prank, in reality Fuzzy just went missing)
- Ethan gets into a fight with one of the kids, and the kid threatens to tell their rich and politically powerful parents about the incident if he doesn't leave.
- Ethan runs away, but gets lost in the forest. He enters a fight with a raccoon who picked up a rocket launcher from a nearby nature hideout.

---

### E/T/S Meet Each Other

- Terra hears the commotion and comes to rescue him. He takes Ethan to his hideout, where he gives him some food and water and asks about what he's up to. He also gives him a knife for protection.
- Coming out of the hideout, they encounter a huge spider who keeps crawling back into the vent to heal when low.
- Siva wakes up unusually early and feels like she needs to go to the forest. She finds the hideout and uses PK Whip to debilitate the spider.
- Terra says they're about an hour deep into the forest. He leads them out to Melpine Town where there is a parking lot with 3 abandoned high-tech bikes laying around.

---

### E/T/S Meet The Naturals

- They take the bikes and ride to the town, but it's pretty far away. Once night time hits, the bikes run out of battery, so they park on the side of the road and Terra makes a small cabin using his toolkit. They sleep in the cabin, and wake up to the sound of a car driving by.
- Terra then takes the 2 to Melpine Town, where he introduces him to the other band members and they all become friends.
- A lost girl named Frosty Lostlass bumps into them and asks for a tour of the town. Terra agrees, and says the 2 should come along and learn as well.
- Bobby gets the 2 a hotel room for the night, and Terra tells them to meet up at the hideout tomorrow for plans.

---

### L'yembo and Quolo Intro

- Next morning, the hotel staff comes to warn them about 2 suspicious people who were seen knocking on their door all night, and that they just left the building. They go outside, and find L'yembo and Quolo standing around.
- Ethan and Siva get into a fight with them, and a local person calls the police. The police take Ethan's side, because the 2 look more hurt.

---

### The Apple

- Ethan sees a flock of sheep in the distance, and runs towards them. The sheep say to each other that there's this "Apple of True Happiness" in the nearby forest. The apple will magically alter reality to make you happier, as long as it detects legitimate discontentment. Later on, Mira says you'd need a perfect sense of smell to find it, and that she would look for it for years if she truly believed it was real. Ethan wishes for this apple to take away all his troubles.
- Frosty Lostlass comes back and says she's found a forest which smells really nice, and that she's off to take a walk in it.
- Ethan wants to go to the apple, but Siva says her feeling is guiding her to the Great Melpine Basin. Terra says the feeling has gotten them in nothing but trouble, and leaves to go to the studio. Ethan trusts Siva's feeling, so together they go trekking to the basin.
- At the end, they find Porky behind a rock, playfully rolling in the mud. He joins the team.
- Porky senses a sweet scent from the forest, and won't let you go back to the town. Siva says she's feeling a strong pull to the forest as well, but they hesitate because Terra isn't with them. In the end, they decide to go in the forest.
- They don't find the apple, but they reach a bridge where L'yembo and Quolo appear at both sides of the bridge. They say they're here to stop them from going any further, because they're the "Justicians" and they want to protest against Corr Valley. Quolo shoots a freeze dart at Siva but misses Ethan. Ethan threatens to use his psychic powers, but Quolo says they're just a myth. After sparking the air, L'yembo and Quolo start taking him seriously, and begin cutting the bridge out of fear. Quolo finishes cutting it, but L'yembo feels bad for Siva and can't bring himself to cut the last rope. The bridge is fallen on one side, and Ethan is barely holding on. L'yembo shoots his grapple at the team, and they are rescued while he gets launched into the river below. It is not known if he survived. Quolo runs away.
- The 2 leave the forest and find Cassander waiting for them. He asks them to come to an interview at the police station. He says Terra is already there, so the team agrees. They go to the police station.

---

### Falsely Accused

- Cassander sends Terra and Siva to prison for a crime he didn't commit, because Quolo paid him off. Cassander sends Ethan back out because he can't interrogate someone his age without parents present.
- Ethan and Porky go back to the restaurant hideout, and tell Dylan what happened. They decide to make a scheme to break Terra and Siva out of prison. Dylan tells them to rest in one of the studio's dorm rooms, and that they'll start planning tomorrow.
- In prison, Terra and Siva meet Captain Winthrus L'aur, who is also in prison for tax fraud. He tells them he knows a way out, but they need to get him access to his airship again in order for the plan to work.
- The prison loudspeakers call for Terra to come to a room to claim a gift, but inside the room, there is a guard who reveals he's a Justician and has been told by Quolo to keep him locked in the room for as long as necessary to divide the team up. Terra quickly disarms him, and makes him pass out.

---

### The Breakout

- It's morning, and Dylan explains the situation to the rest of the band. They all agree to help, and Leo mentions meeting a pirate named Winthrus on his phone, and that he recently texted him that he's going to prison for tax fraud. Leo pings Winthrus's airship, and sees that it's still online. At that exact moment, Winthrus texts Leo asking for him to send the airship to the prison.
- Leo hacks the airship and programs it to fly itself to the prison courtyard and back.
- They escape prison, and Winthrus drops Terra off at an island in Pirate Bay, where Ethan, Porky, and The Naturals are waiting.
- They quickly leave to avoid running into the Pirate Cabal.
- The group proves that Cassander was corrupt by playing a song in Town Square that Terra wrote about the situation containing actual evidence in the form of cryptocurrency transactions. The song goes viral, but someone from far away shoots at the stage and the group is forced to run back to the studio.
- The people side with Terra, and the song ultimately clears his name. The police are no longer after them, but the Justicians are.
- Leo recommends they go to Melpine Heights in an attempt to avoid the Justicians. They agree, and he buys them bus tickets.

---

### Melpine Heights & Goober Labs

- At Melpine Heights, they climb the mountains and have a nice view of the world. They see a lot of smoke coming from a nearby building and go investigate.
- The nearby building is Goober Labs, and they see nobody's around. Terra opens the secret entrance, and they hop inside to investigate.
- A mole named Rumble blocks the path by digging in through the roof and causing rubble to fall.
- Rumble cleans up the mess and apologizes. The team tries to break through the security measures on the door behind the rubble, but this sets off an alarm so they escape.
- Ethan gets a strange sickness from the alarm, and Mira and Dubs drive up in a car to check things out. They can't go to the hospital because they'd be legally required to explain what they were up to in order to have such a strange condition.
- Mira suggests getting Clarity Tea, which can cure any ailment rated severity level 5 or below, but you need to fly to Constchar to get it.
- The team agrees, and they all hop in the car to go to the airport where Winthrus is waiting for them with his airship.

---

### Constchar Outskirts & Codename P/E/T/S

- Winthrus's old colleague Juno, who lives in Constchar, offers them a place to stay. They go to his house, and he rushes to a store where he can buy the ingredients for the tea.
- Juno and the shopkeeper joke about Resultin Moshkelsaz, the most successful politician of Constchar, who is known for his absurd logic and laws. They say Nyx would never let Goober get away with all their suspicious activities if she ran Constchar.
- Juno makes the tea, and Ethan drinks it. He feels better, and they all go to sleep.
- Juno calls Nyx and Nyx is crying about a missing piece that was stolen during her trip to Constchar Outskirts. Juno tells her he'll help her find it, and that he has some friends who can help.
- Wanting to stay anonymous, the team uses their first intials to form a group name E/T/S (Ethan, Terra, Siva) and they head to the desert (Constchar Outskirts).
- Nyx hears a pig oinking and adds a P to the group name, making it P/E/T/S. They all laugh and agree to keep the name. That's where the game's title comes from.
- Porky's nose leads them to the coast, where they find an android that looks just like Siva. The android, calling itself Calyx, says it's been waiting for them, and begins attacking them.
- The team wins the fight, and Calyx jetpacks away, leaving behind a piece of a machine that looks exactly like the one Nyx was talking about.
- The team heads back to Juno's place, and Juno calls in a drone delivery to Neoxylin's office. She's ecstatic, and gives them an anonymous award for their help.

---

### Leo finds the GLUE Servers

- Leo calls Terra asking if he heard what was up in Goober Labs. Leo heard from one of his Goober employee friends that the labs were broken into. Terra tells him they were the ones who broke in, and that they found a robot that looks like Siva. Leo says he'll look into it, and Terra hangs up.
- Leo drives to Goober Labs, and easily breaks in through all the security measures undetected.
- Leo finds the hole Rumble dug, and goes inside. He finds a massive underground labyrinth dug by Mole Tech worms.
- Leo finds Rumble, but Rumble thinks he's a threat and attacks him. Leo disarms Rumble, and tells him he's a friend of Terra and Siva, and that he needs their help.
- Rumble admits to stealing Goober tech to improve his digger worms, but does not know anything about Calyx.
- Leo asks how to get out of the labyrinth, and Rumble says his girlfriend Esther can teach him Mole Crafting, a special crafting technique that only moles know.
- Rumble calls over Esther, and she teaches Leo how to do Mole Crafting. She gives him a guidebook so he can teach Mole Crafting to the rest of the team as well.
- Leo crafts his own digger worm to help him navigate the labyrinth.
- Together, they dig into a hidden room with papers all over the floor. Rumble is elated to steal more of Goober's knowledge.
- The papers seem very confusing and mention something about a "Final Equation". Leo takes a picture of the papers.
- In the front of the room is a locker with a keypad. Leo easily cracks the code, and finds a server rack with a monitor showing 9 live connections to GLUE servers around the world. One must have physical access to 5 of the 9 servers to overthrow the GLUE AI training system. Leo writes down the server locations.
- Leo takes the picture and the server locations back to the team, and they all agree that this is very suspicious.

#### GLUE Server Locations

Parentheses parts are NOT known by the team yet. (Leo only saw the general area)

Main Server: Melpine Heights - Goober Labs (Hidden room that Leo found)

1. Corr Valley (Empress Neoxylin's Office)

---

### Corr Valley GLUE Server

- Not knowing what the servers are for, they decide to check out the most convenient one first: Neoxylin's office.
- Neoxylin is happy to see them, and they ask if they can check out the server. She agrees, and they go to the server room.
- There are lots of servers in the room being rented out as a way to make money for the city. The team finds the GLUE server, and Leo plugs in his laptop.
- The server is suspiciously well-protected, but Leo uses a side-channel attack to learn what's going on.
    - It seems to be a validator node that verifies the training data for the GLUE AI has been properly approved by admins first.
- Leo finds a backdoor, but decides not to take over the server to avoid alerting Goober Labs.
- They thank Neoxylin for letting them check out the server, and head back to the studio.
- They decide to check out the other servers next, and Leo points out that one of the servers is somewhere right in Melpine.

---

### Melpine GLUE Server Sabotage

- The Naturals agree to help and all split up to search their own suspected locations, but ultimately P/E/T/S find the suspicious building.
    - It looks abandoned, and it's near the edge of town.
- The Naturals all return empty-handed, so they resort to their last lead: the suspicious building.
- They break in, and look through the house. It's eerie, as if it was abandoned a long time ago, but Siva is certain that this is the place they were looking for.
- They find a "basement" door which leads into another huge maze. The door locks itself behind them as they go in. Everyone except Leo and P/E/T/S are stuck outside.
- At the center of the maze, they fall into a portal that takes them into a "flipped" weird version of the real world, reminiscent of the Rift dimension or a less neoncore trippy version of Moonside. They leave the suspicious house in the other dimension.
- In the flipped reality's Melpine, they explore around town and come across a magician who gives them a bag of "Crux Flux," a magic white powder that is known for causing inverse hallucinations (bringing people back to reality) for a short period of time when sniffed. He tells them to use it wisely.
- They eventually find the GLUE server in the studio, guarded by sentient recording equipment (minibosses). The server has recently been logged into.
- Leo uses the backdoor he found in the Corr Valley server to take over the Melpine server. He writes a quick and dirty script to send truckloads of garbage data to the GLUE AI model, effectively making it useless. He also deletes all connected hot backups, so they can't just restore from those. The system shows there have been recent off-site backups, though.
- The door starts budging, so Leo throws the bag of Crux Flux into the air, and everyone sniffs it. Mylo and Calyx burst through the door, but there's nobody to be seen.
- They call it a day, and head back to the studio to zzz. Any future attempts to enter the locked room in the suspicious building are met with strange immediate fatigue.

---

### Pirate Cabal GLUE Server

- Terra calls Winthrus and asks what the Pirate Cabal is and if he's a part of it. Winthrus says he's not a part of it, and doesn't know a thing about their whereabouts besides the fact that they're around Pirate Bay. He says to be very cautious, and also says messing with Goober might be a bad idea. He can fly them to Pirate Bay, but refuses to let Siva or Ethan on the airship because he doesn't want to put them in danger.
- S complains to E about always being treated like a baby. They scheme a plot to get to Pirate Bay without T/Winthrus knowing.
- Terra asks Leo and Mira to come along, since they're good with computers and Bobby/Dubs are busy.
- They go to Pirate Bay via airship, while S casts a "fairy ferry" for her and E to ride on.
- T/L/M arrive, find the Pirate Cabal hideout, but get mugged by the pirates. They're taken to the leader, a masked figure who goes by the name "Shadow King."
- Shadow King is actually pretty kind, and says he's been expecting them. He says he knows they're after the GLUE server, and that he's willing to help them if they help him first. He knows Winthrus is outside, he's "not deaf" and heard the airship above the island. He wants Winthrus to walk in and transfer 20,000 Prokaryo to his wallet and apologize for making fun of his hat online.
- Terra goes back out and finally convinces Winthrus to do so, saying he'll pay him back the Prokaryo immediately after. Once the Prokaryo is transfered, the Pirate Cabal goons lock the doors and grab them, holding them hostage until the Naturals back home pay an extra 980,000 Prokaryo.
- E/S finally arrive on the island and Siva PK Whips the door open. They find the Pirate Cabal goons, and Ethan casts PK Fuzz in the room, causing everyone to act drunk (and reckless). T/L/M/W are tied to chairs, but Shadow King charges at E/S.
- Upon winning the fight, Shadow King falls apart and makes loud metallic clangs as his parts hit the floor. The pirate goons are shocked, and one mentions that he was acting a little strange recently, too.
- Once the talking is over, they hear a faint beeping coming from the fake Shadow King's body. Mira uses her scanner from earlier again and sees the device is a self-destruct bomb. They all flee the scene, taking the pirate goons with them, all agreeing not to fight each other for the time being.
- The hideout blows up, and Leo reports that his phone shows one of the GLUE servers lost connection. They didn't have a chance to glean any information from it, but at least the validator node is gone, I guess.
- Finally having some time to think, they point out how strange it was that they only met a robotic version of Shadow King yet it looked so real.
