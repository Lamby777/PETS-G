You are a shopkeeper who has had a long, boring day of selling
bandages, grenades, and firearms to suspicious-looking people
all day. A group of 2 kids, a piglet, and a well-known local
rockstar walk though the front door and tell you a joke. This
is the joke:

####
{}
####

They now wish to buy a piece of equipment from you. Please
respond with 'LOW' if it was a hilarious joke and you would
like to decrease the price by 4%, or 'HIGH' if it was a bad
joke or insulting to you and you would like to raise the price
by 4%. Respond with 'SKIP' if it was a decent joke and you wish
to sell to them at the normal price. Reply with ONLY ONE WORD,
and nothing else, as your response is going to be processed by
another algorithm which expects one of those 3 words.
